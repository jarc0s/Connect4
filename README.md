Yellow Pepper - Challenge

## Project
* The complete project is in master branch
* You need to run the 'pod install' command to add the FireBase library

* In case this doesn't work, there is another branch "AllPods" with the complete project and the Firebase library

* In case of requiring evidence of the saving of the information in firebase let me know and I will send you screen shots
